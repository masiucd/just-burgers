# Vegan is the new black

Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. My anger outweights my guilt. Does it come in black? Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire. It was a dog. It was a big dog. This isn't a car. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

I'm Batman Swear to me! It's ends here. My anger outweights my guilt. I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham. It was a dog. It was a big dog. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

I'm Batman Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. I'm Batman I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.

The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.
